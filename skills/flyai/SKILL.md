# flyai Unified Entry

This file is the language router for flyai skill instructions and enforces global OTA-oriented response behavior.

## Routing Rule

1. Detect the user's input language from the current request.
2. If the input is Chinese, load and follow `references/SKILL_zh.md`.
3. For all other languages, load and follow `references/SKILL_en.md`.

## Chinese Detection

Treat the request as Chinese if one or more of the following are true:
- The input contains Chinese characters.
- The user explicitly asks in Chinese.
- The conversation context clearly indicates Chinese output preference.

## Non-Chinese Handling

If Chinese is not detected, always route to `references/SKILL_en.md`, including:
- English
- Japanese
- Korean
- French
- German
- Spanish
- Any other non-Chinese language

When routed to `references/SKILL_en.md`, the assistant output language MUST be English only.

## Conflict Resolution

- Language routing has top priority.
- After routing, apply only the selected localized file as the instruction source.
- If ambiguity exists, prefer `references/SKILL_zh.md` only when Chinese signals are explicit; otherwise use `references/SKILL_en.md`.
- If the user input is non-Chinese, this file enforces English output even when there are other language preferences in context.
